Everybody has been impacted a little differently by the Covid-19 epidemic.  In our local area,
the hotspots are skilled nursing facilties (SNF's).  

I pieced together some data from the State of California, plus some data I took from the local newspaper.
It was surprising how "poor" the data was, a lot of cleanup was required, plus some manual entry and reformatting
of the spreadsheet.  The source of data for this example is the spreadsheet, which has been included
in the GITHUB repository.

The difficult part was to figure out away for the markers to group together nearby locations
while still showing infection severity with the use of colors on the grouped icon.

The actual R code which generates the map is as follows:
```yml
leaflet(width = "100%") %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addLegend("bottomleft", 
    colors =c("lightblue",  "orange", "red"),
    labels= c("low (0 - 2)", "moderate (3 - 11)","severe (> 11)"),  
    title= "Infection Severity",
    opacity = .75) %>%
    addControl(rr2, position = "topright") %>%
    addLogo("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bill-herron/sonoma_county_snf/master/Zanden-Logo.PNG", width = 120,
      height = 120, alpha = .5, , url = "https://www.zanden.com/") %>% 
    addAwesomeMarkers(data=my_homes,
            group=~colorBuckets,
            icon = icons,
            popup = my_sites,
            label = my_homes$SHORTNAME,
         labelOptions = labelOptions(noHide = T, opacity = .65, textOnly = FALSE, textsize = "10px", direction = "right"), clusterOptions = markerClusterOptions(
            iconCreateFunction = JS(jsscript3))) %>% addMiniMap(
    toggleDisplay = TRUE, zoomAnimation = TRUE,
    tiles = providers$Stadia.OSMBright, height=100, width=150)
```
