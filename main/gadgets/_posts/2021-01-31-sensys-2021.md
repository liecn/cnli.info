## 序言

前些日子刚刚投了paper，感觉自己有些被过度消费了，于是决定花几天时间把今年顶会的paper学习学习，希望能整理成一篇survey。

这篇日志总结了我对 [SenSys2021](http://sensys.acm.org/2020/program/) 个别文章的综述，话题主要集中在无线感知，LPWAN，AI-enabled edge computing。

## TECHNICAL SESSION 1: Look Ma, No Wires! 
[Wireless and RF Sensing]
### s1-paper1 | UWHear: Through-wall Extraction and Separation of Audio Vibrations Using Wireless Signals

- This paper presents UWHear, a system that simultaneously recovers and separates sounds from multiple sources. To enable the noise suppression (e.g., direction beams) while monitoring multiple sources (e.g., Wi-Fi and RFID) with a fine-grained ranging-resolution, an ultra-wide bandwidth is required at a high-frequency range with very short wavelength. However, we cannot rely on mmWave and laser-based systems due to the poor penetration ability. Thus, UWHear exploits the Impulse Radio Ultra-Wideband (IR-UWB) radar to enhance the process of sound recovery, which sends non-continuous short pulses in the time domain while occupying a wide frequency bandwidth. By separating them via the ToF of the reflected pulses, multiple time series can be retrieved from different distance ranges. Working in a sub-10GHz, UWHear strikes a good balance between signal penetration ability and ranging resolution. Further, UWHear can be co-existed with other communication schemes in the same frequency band, with its low peak pulse output power less than 6dB. Evaluations shows UWHear can separate sounds from two sources placed as close as 25cm and retrieves sounds from multiple real-world household tools.

- An UWB radio, by definition, is a radio whose operating frequency occupies a bandwidth more than 500 MHz, and widely used in lower-power communication systems, including 1D audio samples and 2D matrix of IR-UWB. Note that IR-UWB sequentially transmits probe pulses with interval Ts, which can be treated as the sampling rate on the slow time (~microseconds) as time frames. And the ToF within one frame is known as fast time (~picoseconds) as frequency bins.

- We conclude the amount of target micro displacement is linearly proportional to the amplitude of the in-phase or quadratic part of the receiving signal. Thus, it can recover the sound-related vibration information by analyzing the amplitude of the in-phase or quadrature of UWV receiving signals.
    
### s1-paper3 | AcuTe: Acoustic Thermometer Empowered by a Single Smartphone

- This paper proposes Acoustic Thermometer (AcuTe) as the first ambient temperature sensor empowered by a single commodity smartphone. First, it utilizes on-board dual microphones to estimate sound propagation speed, thereby deriving ambient air temperature readings. Note that the phase of chirp signals are adopted to circumvent the low sampling rate (914kHz>48kHz) on commodity hardware. Second, the structure-borne and air-borne propagation are utilized to address the multi-path problem, with low-volume and averaging algorithms. Further, we convert chirp signals into white noises by phase whitening to prevent disruptive audible transmissions. And a Smoothed Pseudo Wigner-Ville Distribution (SPWVD) mask is used to preserve the principle components in de-whitening spectrogram.

- Evaluations demonstrate a robust performance of Acute with a median accuracy of 0.3◦ even at a varying humidity level.

### s1-paper6 | Combating Interference for Long Range LoRa Sensing

- This paper proposes Sen-fence, a LoRa-based sensing system, to significantly increases the sensing range and mitigate the interference simultaneously. Specifically, Sen-fence creates a virtual fence to constrain sensing only within the area of interest. And the key idea is to increase the movement-induced signal variation to its maximum possible value if the reflection signal is from inside the virtual fence and keep the signal variation unchanged if the movement occurs outside of the virtual fence. First, we change the static vector to achieve the 180◦ phase difference between the static and dynamic vectors. Moreover, the amplitude of the composite signal vector can also be changed by tuning the static vector to maximize movement-induced phase variation. Further, we form a `beam` virtual fence in the range of `[𝜃_1 − Δ𝜃_1, 𝜃_1 + Δ𝜃_1]` and only maximize the movement-induced phase variation in the virtual fence by only searching the restricted range of directions and beam width.

- To create a beam radiation pattern using beamforming, two antennas are employed to obtain stable phase difference readings for sensing to avoid the time synchronization, rather than serving the antenna array function in beamforming. With two receivers, the sensing area can be further constrained as a “spot” virtual fence. The size of the “spot” fence can be purely controlled in software to adapt to different requirements. 

- Sen-fence achieves a sensing range of 50 meters, twice the state-of-the-art sensing range for fine-grained respiration monitoring. The strong penetration capability of LoRa enables accurate respiration sensing even through 5 concrete walls at a distance of 9.3 m.

## TECHNICAL SESSION 2: Are we there yet? 
[Location and Localization]

### s2-paper1 | Symphony: Localizing Multiple Acoustic Sources with a Single Microphone Array

- VoLoc observes that smart speakers are typically near a wall to connect to power outlets, in which a single device can localize a single acoustic source by inferring the nearby wall reflection.

- This paper proposes Symphony to concurrently localize multiple acoustic sources with a single microphone array. The insight behind Symphony is that the geometric layout of microphones on the array determines the unique relationship among signals from the same source along the same arriving path, while the source's location determines the DoAs of signals along different arriving paths. Symphony therefore includes a geometry-based filtering module to distinguish signals from different sources along different paths (e.g., LoS, ECHO) and a coherence-based module to identify signals from the same source. 

- The results show that Symphony has a median localization error of 0.694m, which is 68% less than that of the state-of-the-art approach.

### s2-paper6 ｜ FM-Track: Pushing the Limits of Contactless Multi-target Tracking using Acoustic Signals

- This paper proposes a Fine-grained Multi-target Tracking (FM-Track) system via chirp-based acoustic signals. By quantifying the impact of the range, angle and velocity of the target on the phase of reflected signals, we can jointly estimate the sequential chirp frames from an antenna array. Besides, specifically designed algorithms are proposed to deal with the velocity ambiguity and the instantaneous velocity computation for multi-target tracking.

- Extensive experiments show that FM-Track can successfully differentiate two targets with a spacing as small as 1cm, and achieve a median tracking accuracy of 0.86cm and 0.11cm for absolute range and displacement estimates respectively. For multi- target tracking, FM-Track can accurately track four targets and the tracking range can be up to 3m.

- FM-Track is the first attempt to simultaneously extract the target's range, angle, and velocity information via chirp-based acoustic signals, as opposed to the state-of-the-art model for Wi-Fi signals, md-Track.

## TECHNICAL SESSION 3: Let’s Talk
[Communications and Networking]

### s3-paper3 | Aloba: Rethinking ON-OFF Keying Modulation for Ambient LoRa Backscatter 

- Aloba is an ambient LoRa backscatter design using ON-OFF Keying (reflecting the signal when transmitting a bit one, and absorbing the signal when transmitting a bit zero) that provides flexible data rate and transmission range for different IoT applications and deployments. 

- To guarantee the variation of the received signals to be solely determined by the backscatter signal, Aloba first transforms the LoRa carrier signal to sinusoidal carrier signal, by replacing the standard down-chirp
with the conjugate of incoming LoRa chirps. Thus, it can detect the fine-grained changes on the phase and amplitude of the signal. Note that a two-step phase alignment is designed to eliminate the false phase jumping induced by the boundary of each LoRa chirp in signal transformation and intrinsic frequency wrapping within the LoRa chirp. It further reconstruct the signal to tracks the amplitude and phase variation for backscatter signal demodulation overlaid on the carrier LoRa signals, which can be plotted as 2^M clusters from M tags on the constellation diagram. 

- We design a simple yet effective LoRa packet detection circuit that can detect the ambient LoRa signal as low as -60 dBm with 0.3 mW power consumption. Evaluations show Aloba can achieve 39.5–199.4 Kbps data rate at various distances, 10.4–52.4× higher than PLoRa.


### s3-paper | BatComm: Enabling Inaudible Acoustic Communication with High-throughput for Mobile Devices

- The audible band is 8.06-15.98kHz and the near-ultrasound band is 16.03-23.53kHz.

- This paper proposes BatComm, a new acoustic method that integrates OFDM and AM techniques with microphone non-linearity to achieve high-throughput and inaudible acoustic communication. Then it reconstructs the entire audio frequency band from the received ultrasound signal to counteract interference from residual signals. Further BatComm employs a frequency band separation method to better utilize frequency bandwidth.

- Extensive experiments demonstrated that BatComm achieved a throughput as high as 47.49kbps, which is 12x higher than contemporary state-of-the-art acoustic communication systems within a 10cm range. We also explored the possibility of increasing the range up to 2.3m with comparable throughput (i.e., 17.76kbps). 

### s3-paper6 | Breaking the Limitations of Visible Light Communication Through Its Side Channel

- Limitations of traditional VLC have two folds: the blockage of occlusions such as walls, furniture, and even the human itself and the intense ambient light during daytime. For example, the sunlight’s luminance can reach up to 100,000 lux, 100 times larger than that of an LED light for indoor illumination.

- We employ a radio frequency channel, the side-channel created during the process of VLC to avoid its limitations. When a VLC transmitter sends data, not just the visible light signal is emitted out, an RF signal is also leaked out. Since most VLC systems adopt intensity-based modulations to encode data by quickly turning ON/OFF LEDs, in which the transmitter circuit unavoidably involves a rapid current change in the power line for state conversion. And a changing current induces a changing magnetic field around it. Thus, associated with the VLC channel, there exists a side RF channel.

- To efficiently receive the low-frequency side-channel signal while restricting the size of antennas, a specifically designed coil is required as the mobile VLC receiver, which is also supposed to receive the side-chanel signals ina broad frequency range. Further, we should deal with the MIMO VLC separation when multiple side-channel pulses occur at the same time and interfere with each other. 

- By adding a magnetic core and utilizing the unique electromagnetic property of coil (Proximity Effect and Skin Effect), we successfully reduce the coil size to a diameter of 2.56 cm without sacrificing the performance.  To tune the number of coil turns while avoiding mechanically moving a probe, a tunable inductor is incorporated for various sniffing frequency. We further rely on the hardware diversity from different LED models and the unique RF pulses' time-domain signal patterns for multi-VLC separation. And a preamble is designed to obtain all possible time-domain signal patterns when multiple LEDs simultaneously transmit.

- Compared with the existing work in MobiCom, which highlights the sniffing attack by the side-channel of VLC, this paper focuses on the limitations of traditional VLC and MIMO VLC, making it more practical in the wild.

- Compared to state-of-the-art design, we reduce the size of the receiving coil by nearly 90%. Evaluations show that our system can decode overlapped RF signals created by a 3×3 MIMO VLC network five meters away, with various blockages in between. Our system also works under intense ambient light conditions (>100,000 lux).

## TECHNICAL SESSION 4: What’chu Talkin’ ‘bout? 
[Private & Secure Sensing]

### s4-paper2: SLoRa: Towards Secure LoRa Communications with Fine-grained Physical Layer Features

- This paper proposes SLoRa for LoRa node authentication by leveraging two physical layer features–Carrier Frequency Offset (CFO) and spatial-temporal link signature. To extract fine-grained CFO while alleviating the impact of channel noises, SLoRa first designs a novel CFO compensation algorithm by mimicking multiple down-chirps with various CFO compensations. Then it adopt linear fitting to mitigate the noise's randomness if the received up-chirps. Further, a spatial-temporal link signatures is integrated based on the multi-path model, which highly relies on endpoints’ positions of wireless links.

- Combining these two features, SLoRa can distinguish whether the received signal is conveyed from a legitimate LoRa node or not. Experiments covering indoor and outdoor scenarios are conducted to demonstrate a high accuracy for node authentication in SLoRa, which is around 97% indoors (5-25m) and 90% outdoors (400m).

- SLoRa suffers from the heavy attenuation of long-range communication on fine-grained CFO estimation. And both LoRa gateways and nodes should be at relatively fixed positions in order to construct reliable link signatures, which restricts SLoRa from being applied to mobile scenarios. Finally, SLoRa can only defend against active attacks (e.g., man-in-the-middle, jamming, replay, and deauthentication deadlock attack) and makes no exploration of protecting against passive attacks such as eavesdropping attacks and information leakage.

### s4-paper5 | Alexa, Stop Spying on Me!: Speech Privacy Protection Against Voice Assistants

- Assuming the VA is untrustable, MicShield continuously emits a jamming signal to deafen the VA. Meanwhile, it keeps listening and stops jamming immediately when it senses the onset of a wake word. MicShield works offline, keeping all processing local and shredding voice data immediately afterwards. So it is not subject to the privacy risks from the always-listening, cloud-operated VAs.

- The always-on microphones on voice assistants (VAs) have raised series privacy concerns. In this paper, we propose MicShield, the first system to automatically protect speech privacy against always-on microphones. MicShield introduces a novel selectively jamming mechanism, which can obfuscate private speech while passing legitimate voice commands at the phoneme level.


## TECHNICAL SESSION 6: Selfies! 
[Visual and Imaging]

### s6-paper2 | Distream: Scaling Live Video Analytics with Workload-Adaptive Distributed Edge Intelligence

- We present Distream – a distributed workload-adaptive live video analytics system based on the smart camera-edge cluster architecture, achieving the low-latency, high-throughput, and scalable DL-based live video analytics. The underpinning principle behind the design of Distream is to adaptively balance the workloads across smart cameras as well as partition the workloads between cameras and the edge cluster. 

- The task-specific module in general can be represented as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), in which each vertex representing a DNN classifIer is regarded as an individual workload.

- Distream designs a comprehensively distributed framework that spans across smart cameras and the edge cluster, including a DAG partitioner determining the partition point of the locally processing DAG workloads for each camera, a system monitor which continuously monitors the workloads at each camera and edge cluster, and sends the collected workload information to the workload adaptation controller, and a workload adaptation controller which triggers the cross-camera workload balancer if the workload imbalance across cameras is detected to balance the workloads across cameras as well as adaptively identifies the optimal DAG partition point for each camera.

- Distream treats cross-camera workload balancing and camera-cluster partitioning as two separate components.

## TECHNICAL SESSION 7: Never stop learning 
[Machine Learning on Sensors]
### s7-paper5 | RF-Net: A Unified Meta-Learning Framework for RF-enabled One-Shot Human Activity Recognition

- We propose RF-Net, a unified meta-learning framework for RF-enabled one-shot HAR, delivering the capability of being adaptive to new environments with very gew labeled data.

- Our meta-learning framework contains i) a dual-path base HAR network, where both time and frequency domains are dedicated to learning powerful RF features including spatial and attention-based temporal ones, and ii) a metric-based meta-learning framework to enhance the fast adaption capability of the base net- work, including an RF-specific metric module along with a residual classification module.

## TECHNICAL SESSION 8: Staying Healthy 
[Human Activity & Health]
### s8-paper2 | Noninvasive Glucose Monitoring Using Polarized Light

- This paper proposes a noninvasive glucose monitoring system via the polarized light. 

- Depolarization Cancellation: It first analyzes the light absorption and scattering on the skin, covering the ~2% polarized light from the interaction with glucose molecules and ~40% depolarized light (randomized orientation of polarization) by scattering from the tissue. Then, we can measure the difference of optical rotation between the polarized and randomly polarized light for depolarization cancellation, which is associated with the glucose concentration as a feature.

- To boost the system’s sensing robustness under various confounding factors and user diversity, we exploit the diversity in light wavelengths and intensity levels to strengthen the correlation between `I_{feature}` and the `glucose concentration` in InterStitial Fluid (ISF), which is mainly localized in the two outer layers of the skin, namely, epidermis and dermis. First, it can search skin layers to minimize the impact of confounding factors because ISF and confounding factors are not uniformly distributed underneath the skin. Second, since wavelengths contribute to the optical rotation and multiple feature values can be generated at specific glucose concentration, which can further improve the sensing granularity.

- Below 400 nm, continuously illuminated by ultraviolet radiation can cause diseases like erythema, skin aging, and skin cancer. Above 700 nm, infrared radiation can create heat on the skin and potentially increase skin temperature.

- Users first need to input their age, gender, race, skin tone, types of diabetes to the system. The model of CGM is also used to calibrate the labels. No additional calibration is needed for online inference. As sensing data arrives on the fly, our system computes feature vectors and then leverage trained trees ensembles to select features and estimate glucose concentration. Each tree ensemble will generate a prediction score, and the linear combination of all scores is the final estimation of the glucose concentration.

- We built a compact (17 cm × 10 cm × 5 cm) and low-cost (e.g., <$250) prototype using off-the-shelf hardware components, and extensive evaluations (41 patients with diabetes and 9 healthy subjects) show that our system achieves 89% clinical accuracy, and the mean absolute relative differences is 10%. We plan to expand our training data with larger-scale user studies across the hospitals in the U.S. to further improve system accuracy.

## 落幕

这次总结了 SenSys2021 共计43篇文章中的13篇，topic设计声音感知，视频流处理，可见光感知，工具多借助于AI增强，也不乏巧妙的信号处理模型以集成一个完整的系统性工作。我总结下来有如下几点感受：

-  SenSys还是一个非常重视系统设计的会议，我们看到像声音感知的`UWHear`, `ACute`,`BatCom`, `MicShield`, LoRa 的`SLoRa`, `Long Range Sensing`，其实都不是非常困难（甚至是有些直接）的信号处理，但观察验证，实验设计，系统鲁棒性方面的研究都非常扎实。

- AI于无线的结合还是一个非常容易 `中paper` 的方向。尽管我认为像 `RF-Net`类的文章对无线信号的应用和解释都还略显生硬，但能够尝试进行解释并做大范围数据的实验验证，对 AI-enabled Wireless 总归是有利的。

- 13篇文章中对我提升最大的是 `FM-Track`, `Distream` and `PolarizedLight`。 `FM-Track`中关于无线信号多维特征的边界分析，提取方法等是了解无线感知领域的常见feature的指南。`Distream`针对智能视频平台的 `workload imbalance`提出了有效且系统的解决方案，从多摄像头平台到边缘计算设备的信号流处理，workload调度，性能均衡等方面都让人心服口服。`PolarizedLight`的feature提取涉及到硬件平台的有效使用（2 linear polarizing film and 1 liquid crystal）和使能的求差操作，是对 `depolarization cancellation` 的巧妙设计。
