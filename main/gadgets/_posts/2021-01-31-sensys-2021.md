## 序言

前些日子刚刚投了paper，感觉自己有些被过度消费了，于是决定花几天时间把今年顶会的paper学习学习，希望能整理成一篇survey。

这篇日志总结了我对 [SenSys2021](http://sensys.acm.org/2020/program/) 个别文章的综述，话题主要集中在无线感知，LPWAN，AI-enabled edge computing。

## TECHNICAL SESSION 1: Look Ma, No Wires! 
[Wireless and RF Sensing]
### s1-paper1 | UWHear: Through-wall Extraction and Separation of Audio Vibrations Using Wireless Signals

- This paper presents UWHear, a system that simultaneously recovers and separates sounds from multiple sources. To enable the noise suppression (e.g., direction beams) while monitoring multiple sources (e.g., Wi-Fi and RFID) with a fine-grained ranging-resolution, an ultra-wide bandwidth is required at a high-frequency range with very short wavelength. However, we cannot rely on mmWave and laser-based systems due to the poor penetration ability. Thus, UWHear exploits the Impulse Radio Ultra-Wideband (IR-UWB) radar to enhance the process of sound recovery, which sends non-continuous short pulses in the time domain while occupying a wide frequency bandwidth. By separating them via the ToF of the reflected pulses, multiple time series can be retrieved from different distance ranges. Working in a sub-10GHz, UWHear strikes a good balance between signal penetration ability and ranging resolution. Further, UWHear can be co-existed with other communication schemes in the same frequency band, with its low peak pulse output power less than 6dB. Evaluations shows UWHear can separate sounds from two sources placed as close as 25cm and retrieves sounds from multiple real-world household tools.

- An UWB radio, by definition, is a radio whose operating frequency occupies a bandwidth more than 500 MHz, and widely used in lower-power communication systems, including 1D audio samples and 2D matrix of IR-UWB. Note that IR-UWB sequentially transmits probe pulses with interval Ts, which can be treated as the sampling rate on the slow time (~microseconds) as time frames. And the ToF within one frame is known as fast time (~picoseconds) as frequency bins.

- We conclude the amount of target micro displacement is linearly proportional to the amplitude of the in-phase or quadratic part of the receiving signal. Thus, it can recover the sound-related vibration information by analyzing the amplitude of the in-phase or quadrature of UWV receiving signals.
    
### s1-paper3 | AcuTe: Acoustic Thermometer Empowered by a Single Smartphone

- This paper proposes Acoustic Thermometer (AcuTe) as the first ambient temperature sensor empowered by a single commodity smartphone. First, it utilizes on-board dual microphones to estimate sound propagation speed, thereby deriving ambient air temperature readings. Note that the phase of chirp signals are adopted to circumvent the low sampling rate (914kHz>48kHz) on commodity hardware. Second, the structure-borne and air-borne propagation are utilized to address the multi-path problem, with low-volume and averaging algorithms. Further, we convert chirp signals into white noises by phase whitening to prevent disruptive audible transmissions. And a Smoothed Pseudo Wigner-Ville Distribution (SPWVD) mask is used to preserve the principle components in de-whitening spectrogram.

- Evaluations demonstrate a robust performance of Acute with a median accuracy of 0.3◦ even at a varying humidity level.

### s1-paper6 | Combating Interference for Long Range LoRa Sensing

- This paper proposes Sen-fence, a LoRa-based sensing system, to significantly increases the sensing range and mitigate the interference simultaneously. Specifically, Sen-fence creates a virtual fence to constrain sensing only within the area of interest. And the key idea is to increase the movement-induced signal variation to its maximum possible value if the reflection signal is from inside the virtual fence and keep the signal variation unchanged if the movement occurs outside of the virtual fence. First, we change the static vector to achieve the 180◦ phase difference between the static and dynamic vectors. Moreover, the amplitude of the composite signal vector can also be changed by tuning the static vector to maximize movement-induced phase variation. Further, we form a `beam` virtual fence in the range of `[𝜃_1 − Δ𝜃_1, 𝜃_1 + Δ𝜃_1]` and only maximize the movement-induced phase variation in the virtual fence by only searching the restricted range of directions and beam width.

- To create a beam radiation pattern using beamforming, two antennas are employed to obtain stable phase difference readings for sensing to avoid the time synchronization, rather than serving the antenna array function in beamforming. With two receivers, the sensing area can be further constrained as a “spot” virtual fence. The size of the “spot” fence can be purely controlled in software to adapt to different requirements. 

- Sen-fence achieves a sensing range of 50 meters, twice the state-of-the-art sensing range for fine-grained respiration monitoring. The strong penetration capability of LoRa enables accurate respiration sensing even through 5 concrete walls at a distance of 9.3 m.

## TECHNICAL SESSION 2: Are we there yet? 
[Location and Localization]

### s2-paper1 | Symphony: Localizing Multiple Acoustic Sources with a Single Microphone Array

- VoLoc observes that smart speakers are typically near a wall to connect to power outlets, in which a single device can localize a single acoustic source by inferring the nearby wall reflection.

- This paper proposes Symphony to concurrently localize multiple acoustic sources with a single microphone array. The insight behind Symphony is that the geometric layout of microphones on the array determines the unique relationship among signals from the same source along the same arriving path, while the source's location determines the DoAs of signals along different arriving paths. Symphony therefore includes a geometry-based filtering module to distinguish signals from different sources along different paths (e.g., LoS, ECHO) and a coherence-based module to identify signals from the same source. 

- The results show that Symphony has a median localization error of 0.694m, which is 68% less than that of the state-of-the-art approach.

### s2-paper6 ｜ FM-Track: Pushing the Limits of Contactless Multi-target Tracking using Acoustic Signals

- This paper proposes a Fine-grained Multi-target Tracking (FM-Track) system via chirp-based acoustic signals. By quantifying the impact of the range, angle and velocity of the target on the phase of reflected signals, we can jointly estimate the sequential chirp frames from an antenna array. Besides, specifically designed algorithms are proposed to deal with the velocity ambiguity and the instantaneous velocity computation for multi-target tracking.

- Extensive experiments show that FM-Track can successfully differentiate two targets with a spacing as small as 1cm, and achieve a median tracking accuracy of 0.86cm and 0.11cm for absolute range and displacement estimates respectively. For multi- target tracking, FM-Track can accurately track four targets and the tracking range can be up to 3m.

- FM-Track is the first attempt to simultaneously extract the target's range, angle, and velocity information via chirp-based acoustic signals, as opposed to the state-of-the-art model for Wi-Fi signals, md-Track.

## TECHNICAL SESSION 3: Let’s Talk
[Communications and Networking]

### s3-paper3 | Aloba: Rethinking ON-OFF Keying Modulation for Ambient LoRa Backscatter 

- Aloba is an ambient LoRa backscatter design using ON-OFF Keying (reflecting the signal when transmitting a bit one, and absorbing the signal when transmitting a bit zero) that provides flexible data rate and transmission range for different IoT applications and deployments. 

- To guarantee the variation of the received signals to be solely determined by the backscatter signal, Aloba first transforms the LoRa carrier signal to sinusoidal carrier signal, by replacing the standard down-chirp
with the conjugate of incoming LoRa chirps. Thus, it can detect the fine-grained changes on the phase and amplitude of the signal. Note that a two-step phase alignment is designed to eliminate the false phase jumping induced by the boundary of each LoRa chirp in signal transformation and intrinsic frequency wrapping within the LoRa chirp. It further reconstruct the signal to tracks the amplitude and phase variation for backscatter signal demodulation overlaid on the carrier LoRa signals, which can be plotted as 2^M clusters from M tags on the constellation diagram. 

- We design a simple yet effective LoRa packet detection circuit that can detect the ambient LoRa signal as low as -60 dBm with 0.3 mW power consumption. Evaluations show Aloba can achieve 39.5–199.4 Kbps data rate at various distances, 10.4–52.4× higher than PLoRa.


### s3-paper | BatComm: Enabling Inaudible Acoustic Communication with High-throughput for Mobile Devices

### s3-paper6 | Breaking the Limitations of Visible Light Communication Through Its Side Channel

- Limitations of traditional VLC have two folds: the blockage of occlusions such as walls, furniture, and even the human itself and the intense ambient light during daytime. For example, the sunlight’s luminance can reach up to 100,000 lux, 100 times larger than that of an LED light for indoor illumination.

- We employ a radio frequency channel, the side-channel created during the process of VLC to avoid its limitations. When a VLC transmitter sends data, not just the visible light signal is emitted out, an RF signal is also leaked out. Since most VLC systems adopt intensity-based modulations to encode data by quickly turning ON/OFF LEDs, in which the transmitter circuit unavoidably involves a rapid current change in the power line for state conversion. And a changing current induces a changing magnetic field around it. Thus, associated with the VLC channel, there exists a side RF channel.

- To efficiently receive the low-frequency side-channel signal while restricting the size of antennas, a specifically designed coil is required as the mobile VLC receiver, which is also supposed to receive the side-chanel signals ina broad frequency range. Further, we should deal with the MIMO VLC separation when multiple side-channel pulses occur at the same time and interfere with each other. 

- By adding a magnetic core and utilizing the unique electromagnetic property of coil (Proximity Effect and Skin Effect), we successfully reduce the coil size to a diameter of 2.56 cm without sacrificing the performance.  To tune the number of coil turns while avoiding mechanically moving a probe, a tunable inductor is incorporated for various sniffing frequency. We further rely on the hardware diversity from different LED models and the unique RF pulses' time-domain signal patterns for multi-VLC separation. And a preamble is designed to obtain all possible time-domain signal patterns when multiple LEDs simultaneously transmit.

- Compared with the existing work in MobiCom, which highlights the sniffing attack by the side-channel of VLC, this paper focuses on the limitations of traditional VLC and MIMO VLC, making it more practical in the wild.

- Compared to state-of-the-art design, we reduce the size of the receiving coil by nearly 90%. Experimen- tal evaluations show that our system can decode overlapped RF signals created by a 3×3 MIMO VLC network five meters away, with various blockages in between. Our system also works under intense ambient light conditions (>100,000 lux).
